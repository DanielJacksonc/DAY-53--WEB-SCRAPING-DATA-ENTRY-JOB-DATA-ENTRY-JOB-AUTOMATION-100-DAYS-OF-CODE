MY STEPS:
Import Necessary Modules:

Import the required Python modules, including time, os, BeautifulSoup from bs4, requests, and webdriver from selenium.
Define URLs and Selectors:

Specify the URLs for the Google Form (GOOGLE_FORM) and the Zillow Clone website (ZILLOW_URL).
Define XPath selectors for the questions in the Google Form (QUESTION_1, QUESTION_2, QUESTION_3) and the submit button (SUBMIT).
Web Scraping Zillow Data:

Use requests and BeautifulSoup to scrape data from the Zillow Clone website.
Extract property details such as links, addresses, and prices.
Iterate Through Data:

Loop through the extracted data (addresses, prices, links) and print the information.
Fill Google Form Using Selenium:

Initialize a webdriver.Chrome instance with common options.
Open the Google Form URL and locate form elements using XPath selectors.
Fill in the form with the scraped data (address, price, link) using send_keys.
Submit the form by clicking the submit button.
Close WebDriver:

Close the WebDriver to free up system resources.
Handling Exceptions:

Implement error handling, such as catching FileExistsError, to manage potential issues during execution.
Business Use Case:

Consider potential business applications for the web scraping strategy, such as real estate aggregation, market research, or lead generation.
Legal and Ethical Considerations:

Acknowledge legal and ethical considerations related to web scraping, ensuring compliance with terms of use and privacy regulations.
Execution:

Run the script to perform web scraping, form filling, and data submission.
